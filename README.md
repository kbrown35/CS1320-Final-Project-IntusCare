## CS1320 Final Project
### Team Members: Katherine Brown, Jonathan Weisskoff, Melissa Wang
### Client: IntusCare (Alex Rothberg)
#### Spring 2020

## Local Application Instructions

To run this application, you will need to run two servers: a frontend server and a backend server. 

Instructions for setup of the backend server are to be found in setupDB.sh. 
If you already have postgres server running in the background on default port 5432, 
then you don't need to uncomment anything in this file, and you can simply run the bash script with ./sutupDB.sh. 
If not, you will need to uncomment the lines pertinent to you and then run it (e.g. See lines 4 and 7 in setupDB.sh).

To run the front end server, open a new terminal and run the comand "npm start." If npm is not installed, also run the command "npm install."

Then open your browser and type into the URL "localhost:3000".


## IntusCare Patient Acuity Tool Summary

We worked with IntusCare to develop a Patient Acuity Tool that allows for entering and accessing patient acuity/risk information.The current acuity information is collected on paper records and is difficult to manage. Intus Care designated digitization of this tool as a priority as it could have immediate use and impact from some of the PACE organizations they are working with. We created a separate web application that will be integrated into IntusCare current Manager Portal.

We developed a separate web application from IntusCare that will be integrated into IntusCare current Manager Portal app. Questions in the form were modified/redacted for the final turn-in per clientâ€™s request and PACE organization Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA).
